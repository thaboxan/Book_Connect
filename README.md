## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

This project focuses on enhancing code maintainability, extendibility, and readability through:

### Web Components for Encapsulation

The application utilizes custom Web Components to create a modular, reusable codebase:

- `BookPreview`: Displays individual book information
- `FilterDropdown`: Handles genre and author filtering
- `ThemeSwitcher`: Manages theme preferences
- `ShowMoreButton`: Controls pagination functionality

Each component encapsulates its structure, style, and behavior, creating a clear separation of concerns that improves maintainability.

### Abstraction for Maintainability

#### Modular Functions

Functions like `createBookPreviews` are designed to perform specific tasks, making them easy to understand and test. This abstraction allows for code reuse across different parts of the application.

#### Shadow DOM for Scoped Styles

The application leverages Shadow DOM in Web Components (`this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })`) to scope styles to specific components. This prevents styles from leaking or being affected by global styles, ensuring consistent styling and reducing CSS management complexity.
