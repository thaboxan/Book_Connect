## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Web Components for Encapsulation

The application utilizes custom Web Components for a modular, reusable codebase:
- `BookPreview`: Displays individual book information.
- `FilterDropdown`: Handles genre and author filtering.
- `ThemeSwitcher`: Manages theme preferences.
- `ShowMoreButton`: Controls pagination functionality.

Each component encapsulates its structure, style, and behavior, creating a clear separation of concerns that improves maintainability.

### Abstraction for Maintainability

- **Modular Functions:** Functions like `createBookPreviews` are designed to perform specific tasks, making them easy to understand and test. This abstraction allows for code reuse across different parts of the application.
- **Shadow DOM for Scoped Styles:** The application leverages Shadow DOM in Web Components (`this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })`) to scope styles to specific components. This prevents styles from leaking or being affected by global styles, ensuring consistent styling and reducing CSS management complexity.
